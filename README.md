# Best-University-Finder-App
Hi all! This repository contains an app that I created in the past called "Best University Finder", I used java and designed GUI through implementing JFC/Swing. Android Studio was used to create the app. • All 3400 American national universities' detailed information is included in 50 specific subsections. Maintained and queried universities’ data through implementation of JDBC by connecting the original Java project package and PostgreSQL database.
